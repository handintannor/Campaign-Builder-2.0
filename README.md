# Campaign-Builder-2.0
A generator meant to help writers and worldbuilders fill out their worlds with details. Including fine control over item generation and settings. The design is meant to create information to be interpreted, rather than picking from an arbitrary list of items (Kind of like Aspects in the FATE RPG).
